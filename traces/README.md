# Traces

This directory contains traces collected with librnr and related tools.

## Adding Traces

When adding traces, please create a new directory using the following naming convention:

```
YYYYMMDD[THHMM]-<apps>[-<notes>]
```

You can use the notes to indicate specific environment configurations such as network conditions or device types.

Separate words within `<apps>` or `<notes>` can be separated by underscores (`_`).
